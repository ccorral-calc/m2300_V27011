	STARTUP SCRIPT DESCTIPTION
	
The m2300 can now process "." from a file residing on the recorder in the /usr/calculex directory. This file MUST be named StartupScript.
The syntax of the command must be Chapter 10 "." or any provided Calculex "." commands. For example, to automatically publish Time Code(ID 1) and 
a single Video(ID 21), the following command will be in the script.

	.publish start 192.168.0.12 33333 1 21
	
The current system can process up to 32 "." commands in this file.



	LOADING A "STARTUP SCRIPT" TO THE M2300
	
 1) When the unit boots up and you get an "*", type in ..exit
 2) Change directories to /tmp with the following command ->  cd /tmp 
 2) Load Startup Script using lrz 
 3) Copy <filename> to /usr/calculex <cp <filename> /usr/calculex/StartupScript> .
 4) Type in sync
 5) The script is now loaded into the system. It can now be controlled from the m2300 using the following commands
 	a) .set script on  -> This turns on the script that will be run at startup.
 	b) .set script off -> This turns off the script at startup.
 	
 	After either command, type in .save
